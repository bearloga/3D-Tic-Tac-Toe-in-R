To be played with another person on the same computer

## Game Rules

To win, a player must place four of their symbols on four squares that line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, on a single grid, or spaced evenly over all four grids.

P.S. Same square across all four planes counts as a victory as well.

## Setup

1. Copy and paste the entire script into R
2. Feel free to customize the symbols and their colors
3. Enter `play()` to begin playing

**Optional**: use `play(N)` to play a (N-by-N-by-N) match and `play(xname = "Mikhail", oname = "Sam")` to preset names
